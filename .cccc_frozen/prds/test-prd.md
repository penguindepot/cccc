# PRD: test-prd

## Executive Summary

This is a test Product Requirements Document created to validate the PRD command functionality in the CCCC system. It demonstrates the proper structure and format expected for PRD documentation.

## Problem Statement

We need to ensure that the PRD creation command works correctly and produces properly formatted documents that can be used by the CCCC system for epic generation and project management.

**Why is this important now?**
- Validates the PRD workflow
- Ensures proper file structure and metadata
- Tests the integration between PRD creation and epic parsing

## User Stories

**Primary Persona: Development Team**
- As a developer, I want to test PRD creation so I can verify the command works correctly
- As a product manager, I want sample PRDs to understand the expected format and structure

**User Journey:**
1. Developer runs the PRD creation command
2. System generates a structured PRD document
3. PRD can be parsed into implementation epics
4. Team can track progress from concept to delivery

**Pain Points Being Addressed:**
- Need for standardized documentation format
- Validation of automated tooling
- Template for future PRD creation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Generate PRD with proper frontmatter metadata
- Include all required sections with sample content
- Save to correct directory structure (.cccc/prds/)
- Use proper naming conventions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** PRD creation should complete in under 30 seconds
- **Security:** No sensitive information in test documents
- **Scalability:** Template should work for various feature sizes

## Success Criteria

- ✅ PRD file created with proper structure
- ✅ Frontmatter contains all required fields
- ✅ Document follows markdown formatting standards
- ✅ Can be successfully parsed by /cccc:prd:parse command

**Key Metrics:**
- File creation success rate: 100%
- Proper frontmatter validation: Pass
- Epic parsing compatibility: Pass

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Limitations:**
- Must use markdown format
- Frontmatter must be YAML compliant
- File naming must follow kebab-case convention

**Timeline Constraints:**
- This is an immediate test - no delivery timeline

**Resource Limitations:**
- Test document only - minimal content requirements

## Out of Scope

- Real feature implementation
- Detailed technical specifications
- User interface mockups
- Performance benchmarking beyond basic validation

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- File system write permissions
- CCCC system configuration
- Markdown parser compatibility

**Internal Dependencies:**
- PRD parsing command functionality
- Epic generation system
- Project directory structure

## Implementation Notes

This PRD serves as both a test case and a template for future PRD creation. The structure demonstrates:
- Proper frontmatter formatting
- Complete section coverage
- Measurable success criteria
- Clear scope boundaries
