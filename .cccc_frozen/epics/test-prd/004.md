# Task: Add comprehensive error recovery

## Description
Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms across all PRD workflow commands to ensure graceful failure handling, clear error messaging, and proper cleanup of partial operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All commands handle file system errors (permissions, disk space, etc.)
- [ ] Clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Partial operations are properly cleaned up on failure
- [ ] Commands provide recovery suggestions for common errors
- [ ] Exit codes follow standard conventions (0=success, non-zero=failure)

## Technical Details
- Add error handling to /cccc:prd:new, /cccc:prd:parse, and related commands
- Implement proper cleanup for failed file operations
- Add validation for prerequisites (git repository, write permissions)
- Create standardized error message format with solutions
- Test error scenarios with validation framework

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Validation framework needed for testing error scenarios)
- [ ] Task 003 (Parser improvements needed for validation errors)
- [ ] Command infrastructure must be stable

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 1.5 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Error handling implemented across all PRD commands
- [ ] All error scenarios tested and documented
- [ ] Cleanup mechanisms prevent partial state corruption
- [ ] Error messages provide clear resolution steps
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms tested and validated
