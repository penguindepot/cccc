# Epic: test-prd

## Overview
Implementation of validation framework for the CCCC PRD workflow system, focusing on automated testing of PRD generation, parsing, and epic creation capabilities. This serves as both a functional test harness and a reference template for future PRD implementations.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Validation-First Approach**: Leverage existing CCCC command patterns for consistency
- **File-Based Testing**: Use markdown files as test artifacts that double as documentation
- **Minimal Infrastructure**: No external dependencies; pure bash/markdown implementation
- **Template Pattern**: Design test PRD to serve as reusable template for real PRDs

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- Command-line interface validation scripts
- Markdown template generation logic
- Frontmatter YAML parser integration

### Backend Services
- File system operations for PRD/epic management
- Validation logic for structure and metadata
- Command execution framework testing

### Infrastructure
- Local file system structure (.cccc/prds/, .cccc/epics/)
- Git integration for version control
- No external services required (self-contained)

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Validate existing PRD creation command
- **Phase 2**: Test epic parsing functionality
- **Phase 3**: Implement end-to-end workflow validation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Use defensive file operations with proper error handling
- **Testing Approach**: Self-validating through successful execution

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Validation Framework: Create test harness for PRD commands
- [ ] Template Standardization: Finalize PRD template structure
- [ ] Parser Enhancement: Improve frontmatter validation logic
- [ ] Error Handling: Add comprehensive error recovery
- [ ] Documentation: Update command documentation with examples
- [ ] Integration Tests: End-to-end workflow validation

## Dependencies
- CCCC command framework must be operational
- File system write permissions in .cccc/ directory
- Markdown parser for frontmatter extraction
- Date command for ISO timestamp generation

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate for valid PRD creation
- **Performance**: < 5 seconds for PRD generation and parsing
- **Validation**: Proper YAML frontmatter in all generated files
- **Compatibility**: Full integration with epic decomposition workflow
- **Documentation**: Template serves as clear example for users

## Tasks Created
- [ ] 001.md - Create test harness for PRD commands (M - 45 min)
- [ ] 002.md - Finalize PRD template structure (S - 30 min)
- [ ] 003.md - Improve frontmatter validation logic (M - 1 hour)
- [ ] 004.md - Add comprehensive error recovery (L - 1.5 hours)
- [ ] 005.md - Update command documentation with examples (M - 45 min)
- [ ] 006.md - End-to-end workflow validation (M - 1 hour)

Total tasks: 6
Estimated total effort: 5.5 hours

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 2-3 hours (updated to 5.5 hours based on detailed task breakdown)
- **Resource Requirements**: Single developer
- **Critical Path**: Validation framework → Template finalization → Integration testing
