# Task: Create test harness for PRD commands

## Description
Develop a comprehensive validation framework to test PRD creation, parsing, and epic generation workflows. This framework will serve as both a quality assurance tool and a template for future PRD testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test harness validates PRD creation with all required sections
- [ ] Framework verifies proper YAML frontmatter generation
- [ ] System tests epic parsing functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Error conditions are properly handled and tested
- [ ] All validation scripts return proper exit codes

## Technical Details
- Create validation scripts in .claude/scripts/cccc/
- Implement checks for frontmatter structure and content
- Add file system permission and write operation tests
- Validate generated timestamps match ISO 8601 format
- Test command execution with both valid and invalid inputs

## Dependencies
- [ ] CCCC command framework operational
- [ ] File system write permissions in .cccc/ directory
- [ ] Bash scripting environment available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 45 minutes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Validation scripts implemented and executable
- [ ] All test cases pass successfully
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Code reviewed for bash best practices
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples
