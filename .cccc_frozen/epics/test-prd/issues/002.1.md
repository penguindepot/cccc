# Issue: Standardize PRD template structure

## Overview
# Issue #002.1: Standardize PRD template structure

## Overview
Finalize and standardize the PRD template structure in test-prd.md to serve as the canonical example for PRD creation and validation testing.

## Files to Modify
1. `.cccc/prds/test-prd.md` (modify)

## Implementation Sketch

Update the existing test-prd.md to have a standardized structure:

# Test PRD for CCCC Validation Framework

## Problem Statement

The CCCC system needs a comprehensive validation framework to ensure PRD creation, parsing, and epic generation workflows function correctly. Currently, there is no systematic way to test these critical workflows.

## Solution Overview

Create a test harness that validates all aspects of the PRD workflow:
- PRD creation with proper frontmatter
- Template validation and structure compliance
- Parsing logic and epic generation
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- End-to-end workflow integration

## User Stories

### US001: PRD Creation Validation
**As a** CCCC user
**I want** PRD creation to be validated automatically
**So that** I can trust that PRDs are created with correct structure and metadata

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PRD files have valid YAML frontmatter
- All required fields are present and properly formatted
- File structure follows CCCC conventions
- Creation process handles errors gracefully

### US002: PRD Parsing Validation  
**As a** CCCC user
**I want** PRD parsing to be validated automatically
**So that** I can trust that epics are generated correctly from PRDs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PRD content is parsed accurately
- Epic directories are created with proper structure
- Task decomposition follows defined patterns
- Dependencies and relationships are preserved

### US003: Error Recovery Testing
**As a** CCCC user  
**I want** error scenarios to be tested automatically
**So that** I can trust the system handles failures gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Invalid PRDs are handled properly
- Partial failures are recovered from
- Clear error messages are provided
- System state remains consistent

## Technical Requirements

### Data Requirements
- Test PRD with realistic content structure
- YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- Multiple user stories for parsing validation
- Technical requirements for epic generation

### System Requirements
- Integration with existing CCCC command structure
- Compatibility with current validation patterns
- Support for automated testing workflows
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Performance Requirements
- PRD creation: < 5 seconds
- PRD parsing: < 10 seconds
- Validation checks: < 2 seconds
- End-to-end workflow: < 30 seconds

## Implementation Notes

This PRD serves as both a functional specification and a test artifact. The content should be realistic enough to generate meaningful epics while containing all elements needed for comprehensive validation testing.

The frontmatter structure defined here becomes the standard for all CCCC PRDs, ensuring consistency and reliability across the system.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PRD has standardized YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- [ ] Problem statement clearly defines validation needs
- [ ] Solution overview covers all testing aspects
- [ ] User stories provide clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical requirements specify performance targets
- [ ] Content structure supports epic generation testing
- [ ] File serves as template for future PRD creation

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational template

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented according to implementation sketch
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Template follows CCCC PRD patterns and standards
- [ ] Content supports both testing and example purposes
- [ ] Ready for validation logic improvements (Issues #003.1, #003.2)

**jeunesse.paulien** (2025-08-29T00:50:32.221Z):
Put the test prd file in another place. test-prd.md is already taken. Maybe put it in something like template-prd-test.md
