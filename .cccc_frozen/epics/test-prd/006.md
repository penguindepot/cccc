# Task: End-to-end workflow validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete PRD workflow from creation through epic generation and task decomposition, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full workflow test: PRD creation → parsing → epic generation → task decomposition
- [ ] Integration tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks ensure commands complete within expected timeframes
- [ ] Validation confirms proper file structure and content at each step
- [ ] Tests can be run repeatedly without manual cleanup

## Technical Details
- Create end-to-end test script that exercises complete workflow
- Implement automated validation of generated files and structures
- Add performance timing for each workflow step
- Test workflow with various PRD content types and structures
- Ensure tests are idempotent and can be run multiple times

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks must be completed for full integration testing
- [ ] Validation framework (Task 001) provides testing infrastructure
- [ ] Template structure (Task 002) defines expected outputs
- [ ] Parser improvements (Task 003) ensure reliable processing
- [ ] Error handling (Task 004) covers failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation (Task 005) provides reference for expected behavior

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1 hour

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete end-to-end test suite implemented
- [ ] All workflow steps validated and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 5 seconds total)
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test results serve as validation of epic completion
