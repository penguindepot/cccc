# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### PRISM Package Architecture Pattern (New)
**Distribution System**: CCCC is now architected as a comprehensive PRISM package with flexible installation:
- **Three Installation Variants**: Minimal (10 commands), Standard (25 commands), Full (40+ commands)
- **Automated Setup**: Pre/post installation hooks with dependency management
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete package lifecycle with backup and cleanup capabilities
- **Configuration Integration**: Automatic creation of .cccc/cccc-config.yml with PRISM metadata
- **Benefits**: Easy distribution, flexible deployment, standardized installation process

### Branch-Based Development Pattern (Established Architecture)
**Streamlined Development**: Transitioned from complex worktree-based to streamlined branch-based development:
- **Direct Branch Operations**: Issues implement directly on branches without worktree complexity
- **Simplified Workflow**: issue:start command replaces mr:start for immediate branch-based development
- **Reduced Overhead**: Eliminated worktree orchestration while maintaining all core functionality
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Simpler codebase with branch-operations.md replacing worktree-operations.md
- **Benefits**: Faster development cycle, reduced system complexity, easier maintenance

### Command-Based Architecture
The system implements a command pattern where each operation is:
- Self-contained with validation and execution logic
- Defined in markdown with structured frontmatter
- Tool-permission aware for security
- Composable with other commands

### Script Separation Pattern (New)
Complex commands now follow a separation pattern:
- **Command Files**: Handle validation, prerequisites, and user interface
- **Script Files**: Contain complex logic and heavy computation (.claude/scripts/cccc/)
- **Benefits**: Cleaner command structure, better maintainability, reusable logic
- **Example**: epic-sync.sh handles all sync logic while sync.md handles validation

### Validation-First Pattern
Every command follows strict validation:
1. **Preflight Checks**: Validate prerequisites before execution
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure parameters meet requirements
3. **State Validation**: Verify system state is appropriate
4. **Output Validation**: Confirm successful completion

### Hybrid Storage Architecture (New)
Major architectural shift from pure markdown to hybrid approach:
- **Human-Facing**: Markdown for epics, PRDs, and documentation
- **Machine-Readable**: YAML for metadata, relationships, and state
- **Content Separation**: Issue bodies in clean markdown files, metadata in YAML
- **Benefits**: 30-40% token reduction, eliminates parsing issues, maintains human readability

### Frontmatter Metadata Pattern
All context and PRD files include:
```yaml
---
created: ISO 8601 timestamp
last_updated: ISO 8601 timestamp
version: Semantic version
author: System identifier
---
```

## Design Decisions

### YAML-Driven Issue Management (New Architecture)
- **Structure**: analysis.yaml contains all issue metadata and relationships
- **Content Files**: Clean markdown files for issue bodies (issues/001.1.md)
- **State Tracking**: sync-state.yaml for complete sync metadata
- **Benefits**: Direct data access, no parsing timeouts, stable filenames
- **Pre-calculated Dependencies**: All cross-references computed before issue creation

### PRISM Package Definition Pattern
- **prism-package.yaml**: Complete package specification with variants, hooks, and dependencies
- **Structure Mapping**: File-based installation mapping for commands, scripts, agents, and documentation
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Pre/post install/uninstall automation with safety checks and backups
- **Dependency Management**: Automated installation of system tools (yq, jq, gh, glab)
- **Benefits**: Standardized distribution, automated setup, flexible installation options

### Markdown as Configuration
- **Rationale**: Human-readable, version-controllable, IDE-friendly
- **Benefits**: No compilation, easy editing, built-in documentation
- **Trade-offs**: Limited type safety, requires parsing (now minimized with YAML hybrid)
- **PRISM Integration**: Packages markdown-based command definitions with automated installation

### File-Based State Management
- **Approach**: Separate files for different context aspects
- **Benefits**: Granular updates, parallel processing, clear separation
- **Structure**: 9 specialized context files for comprehensive coverage

### Sequential Issue Creation Pattern (New)
- **Predictable Numbering**: Issues get numbers epic+1, epic+2, etc.
- **Pre-formatted Cross-References**: All dependencies resolved before creation
- **Stable Content**: Issue body files never rename or move
- **Complete State**: All mappings preserved in sync-state.yaml
- **Benefits**: Eliminates post-creation updates, reliable cross-references, atomic operations

### Dependency-Aware Workflow Management (New)
- **Real-Time Status**: Query GitLab/GitHub APIs for current issue states
- **Dependency Resolution**: Analyze analysis.yaml to determine blocked vs ready issues
- **Conflict Detection**: Warn about issues that shouldn't be worked on in parallel
- **Phase Prioritization**: Sort recommendations by phase and estimated effort
- **Progress Tracking**: Track completion timestamps and celebrate milestones
- **Benefits**: Always know which issues are actionable, prevent workflow conflicts

### API Integration Pattern
- **Multi-Platform**: Support both GitLab (glab) and GitHub (gh) CLI tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable or rate-limited
- **Caching Strategy**: Store results in sync-state.yaml to minimize repeated calls
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backup with cleanup to prevent file corruption
- **Status Synchronization**: Keep local state in sync with remote platform state
- **Benefits**: Reliable real-time data with fault tolerance

### Bidirectional Sync Pattern
- **Comment Processing**: Parse structured commands (/update) and feedback from platform
- **Content Synchronization**: Replace local files with latest platform content
- **Collaborative Updates**: Post processing summaries back as platform comments
- **Author Attribution**: Track comment authors and timestamps for feedback history
- **Local-First Workflow**: Maintain local development focus with platform collaboration
- **Audit Trail**: Preserve complete history on platform while keeping local files current
- **Benefits**: Seamless collaboration without losing local development efficiency

### Complete Development Workflow Pattern (Updated for Branch-Based)
- **Branch-Based Implementation**: Direct issue implementation on branches without worktree complexity
- **Implementation Launch**: cccc:issue:start creates branch and launches specialized development agents
- **State Tracking**: Record work initiation timestamp and implementation progress
- **Agent Integration**: Use specialized sub-agents for focused development work
- **Workflow Sequencing**: Simplified sequence - epic:sync → issue:start → development → mr workflow
- **Benefits**: Streamlined development process with reduced complexity and faster iteration

### Git-Aware Operations
- **Integration**: Commands check git status for context freshness
- **Validation**: Detect uncommitted changes and branch switches
- **History**: Leverage git log for progress tracking

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
- Continue with partial context if some files missing
- Warn but proceed for non-critical failures
- Fail fast only for critical errors

### Error Recovery Strategy
1. Identify error type and severity
2. Attempt automatic recovery if possible
3. Provide specific remediation steps
4. Never leave corrupted state

### User Feedback Pattern

- Progress indicators for long operations
- Comprehensive summaries after completion
- Warnings for potential issues

## Consistency Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- **Commands**: Verb-noun format (e.g., `create`, `update`, `validate`)
- **Files**: Descriptive kebab-case
- **Variables**: Contextual placeholders (e.g., `$ARGUMENTS`)

### Timestamp Standardization
- Always use ISO 8601 format
- UTC timezone for consistency
- Real system time via `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`

- Structured summaries with statistics
- Hierarchical information presentation

## Integration Patterns

### Sub-Agent Delegation
- File-analyzer for large file processing
