# Project Overview

## What is CCCC?
CCCC (Claude Code Command Center) is a comprehensive command and context management system that transforms how developers work with Claude Code by providing persistent session management, structured workflows, and deep GitLab/GitHub integration. The system has transitioned from complex worktree-based to streamlined branch-based development, significantly simplifying workflows while maintaining all core functionality.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Context Management System
- **Create**: Generate comprehensive project documentation automatically
- **Prime**: Load context at the start of new sessions
- **Update**: Keep context current as project evolves
- **Validate**: Ensure context integrity and freshness
- **Close**: Clean session termination with state summary
- **Benefits**: Never lose project context between sessions with proper lifecycle management

### 📋 PRD Management Workflow
- **Create PRDs**: Structured product requirement documents with guided discovery
- **Parse to Epics**: Convert requirements into actionable implementation tasks
- **Decompose Tasks**: Break epics into focused, parallel work streams
- **Track Progress**: Monitor implementation status
- **Benefits**: Seamless requirement to implementation pipeline

### 🚀 Epic Analysis System
- **Task Decomposition**: Break tasks into individual GitHub issues (max 3 files, 500 LOC each)
- **Parallel Execution**: 7-phase execution strategy with 1.65x speedup (3.33h vs 5.5h sequential)
- **Implementation Sketches**: Detailed code examples and file modification plans
- **Dependency Management**: Phase-based execution with conflict risk analysis
- **Benefits**: Optimized development workflow with clear, actionable work items

### 🔧 Extensible Command Framework
- **Modular Design**: Each command is self-contained
- **Validation-First**: Comprehensive checks before execution
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling with clear guidance
- **Benefits**: Reliable, predictable command execution

### 🔄 Intelligent Issue Management
- **Dependency-Aware Workflow**: Smart issue prioritization based on dependencies and phase ordering
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Query GitLab/GitHub APIs for current issue states and completion progress
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Fetch issue content and comments, process updates, post summaries back to platform
- **Structured Comment Processing**: Parse /update commands and feedback comments with author attribution
- **Collaborative Refinement**: Enable team collaboration through platform comments while maintaining local-first workflow
- **Benefits**: Always know which issues to work on next, seamless collaboration, platform audit trails

### 🔄 Complete MR Lifecycle Management
- **Issue Start**: Launch implementation work directly on branches with validation and dependencies
- **MR Update**: Fetch and parse MR comments, categorize feedback, identify actionable /fix commands
- **MR Fix**: Automated implementation of requested changes through agent-based development
- **MR Cleanup**: Post-merge branch cleanup with branch deletion and sync state updates
- **Review Cycle**: Complete automation from feedback receipt to implementation to confirmation posting and cleanup
- **Benefits**: Streamlined end-to-end merge request lifecycle with simplified branch management

### 🗄️ Epic Archive System
- **Complete Lifecycle Closure**: Archive completed epics by closing all remaining open issues on platform
- **Branch Cleanup**: Delete all associated epic and issue branches safely
- **Documentation Preservation**: Move all epic files and PRDs to .cccc_frozen directory for safekeeping
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive archive metadata tracking what was closed and when
- **Dry-Run Preview**: Safe preview mode to see what would be archived before execution
- **Benefits**: Clean project closure with full documentation preservation and platform cleanup

### 🔗 Multi-Platform Integration
- **GitHub/GitLab Support**: Dual platform support with automatic detection
- **Issue Synchronization**: Sync epics and individual issues with cross-reference updates
- **Repository Management**: Branch, commit, push workflows with direct branch management
- **Development Workflow**: Streamlined branch-based development for focused work
- **Benefits**: Streamlined development on both major Git platforms
