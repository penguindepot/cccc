# Project Progress

## Current Status
The CCCC (Claude Code Command Center) system has successfully completed major architecture transition and is now distributed as a comprehensive PRISM package v1.1.0. The system operates with streamlined branch-based workflow, removing worktree dependencies and implementing simplified development processes. The project has been packaged for distribution with three installation variants (minimal: 10 commands, standard: 25 commands, full: 40+ commands) and includes automated setup with dependency management. Core functionality includes: cccc:issue:mr for creating platform MRs/PRs, cccc:issue:start for launching implementation work directly on branches, cccc:mr:update for syncing reviewer feedback, cccc:mr:fix for automatically implementing requested changes, cccc:mr:cleanup for post-merge branch cleanup, and cccc:epic:archive for complete epic lifecycle closure. The system is now ready for widespread distribution through the PRISM package ecosystem.

## Recent Work Completed (Latest First)
- **PRISM Package Distribution**: Successfully packaged CCCC v1.1.0 as comprehensive PRISM package with three installation variants (minimal/standard/full), automated setup hooks, dependency management for yq/jq/gh/glab tools, comprehensive package metadata, and lifecycle management including pre/post install/uninstall hooks with backup and cleanup capabilities
