# Project Brief

## Project Name
CCCC - Claude Code Command Center

## Executive Summary
CCCC is a comprehensive command and context management system distributed as a PRISM package that extends Claude Code's capabilities to provide persistent session management, structured product development workflows, and deep GitLab/GitHub integration. It solves the critical problem of context loss between AI coding sessions while establishing reproducible development patterns. The system is now available as a distributable package with flexible installation variants to meet different project complexity needs.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Developers using Claude Code face significant productivity loss due to:
- Context amnesia between sessions requiring repeated explanations
- No structured workflow for requirement to implementation
- Manual processes for common development tasks
- Lack of GitLab-specific tooling integration

### Why Now
- Increasing complexity of AI-assisted development projects
- Growing need for session continuity in long-running projects
- Demand for structured, reproducible development workflows
- Claude Code adoption requiring specialized tooling

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Maintain full project context across Claude Code sessions
2. **Streamline Workflows**: Provide structured paths from requirements to implementation
3. **Enhance Productivity**: Reduce repetitive tasks and manual processes
4. **Ensure Quality**: Validation-first approach to prevent errors
5. **Enable Distribution**: Package system for easy installation and sharing across projects

### Secondary Goals
- Build extensible command framework
- Create reusable patterns for AI development
- Establish best practices for Claude Code usage
- Foster consistent development practices

## Scope

### In Scope
- Context management (create, prime, update, validate)
- PRD lifecycle management
- Command system infrastructure
- GitLab/GitHub dual platform integration
- Session persistence mechanisms
- Documentation and validation
- PRISM package system integration
- Flexible installation variants (minimal, standard, full)
- Automated setup and dependency management

### Out of Scope
- GUI/web interface
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Cloud storage/sync
- Direct IDE integrations (beyond Claude Code)
- Database-backed storage systems

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- Working context persistence between sessions
- PRD creation and parsing capabilities
- Command validation and error handling
- Basic GitLab integration
- Comprehensive documentation

### Should Have
- MCP Thread Continuity integration
- Automated context updates
- Advanced GitLab features
- Performance optimization
- Extended command library

### Could Have
- Web dashboard
- Analytics and metrics
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud backup
- IDE plugins

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within Claude Code environment
- File-based storage only (no database)
- Markdown configuration format
- Local execution only
- Git as version control

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer maintenance
- No external dependencies
- Minimal system requirements
- Open source model

### Time Constraints
- Immediate need for basic functionality
- Iterative development approach
- Feature prioritization based on usage

## Stakeholders

### Direct Users
- Individual developers using Claude Code
- Product managers creating specifications
- DevOps engineers automating workflows
- Teams adopting AI-assisted development
- Organizations standardizing development workflows

### Indirect Beneficiaries
- Development teams adopting AI tools
- Organizations using GitLab
- Claude Code community

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Claude Code API changes
- **Mitigation**: Minimal coupling, version compatibility checks

### Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: Learning curve for new users
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, clear error messages

### Maintenance Risks
- **Risk**: Feature creep
- **Mitigation**: Strict scope management, modular architecture

## Deliverables

### Phase 1 (Complete)
- Core command infrastructure
- Basic context management
- PRD workflow implementation
- Branch-based development workflow
- Complete MR/PR lifecycle automation
- Dual platform support (GitLab/GitHub)
- Epic and issue management systems
- PRISM package system integration

### Phase 1.5 (Current)
- Performance optimization (30-40% context reduction)
- Preflight check extraction
- Agent context isolation
- Command execution optimization

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- MCP Thread Continuity integration
- Advanced automation features
- Package registry integration
- Multi-package dependency management
