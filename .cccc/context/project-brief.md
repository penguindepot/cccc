# Project Brief

## Project Name
CCCC - Claude Code Command Center

## Executive Summary
CCCC is a command and context management system that extends Claude Code's capabilities to provide persistent session management, structured product development workflows, and deep GitLab integration. It solves the critical problem of context loss between AI coding sessions while establishing reproducible development patterns.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Developers using Claude Code face significant productivity loss due to:
- Context amnesia between sessions requiring repeated explanations
- No structured workflow for requirement to implementation
- Manual processes for common development tasks
- Lack of GitLab-specific tooling integration

### Why Now
- Increasing complexity of AI-assisted development projects
- Growing need for session continuity in long-running projects
- Demand for structured, reproducible development workflows
- Claude Code adoption requiring specialized tooling

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Maintain full project context across Claude Code sessions
2. **Streamline Workflows**: Provide structured paths from requirements to implementation
3. **Enhance Productivity**: Reduce repetitive tasks and manual processes
4. **Ensure Quality**: Validation-first approach to prevent errors

### Secondary Goals
- Build extensible command framework
- Create reusable patterns for AI development
- Establish best practices for Claude Code usage
- Foster consistent development practices

## Scope

### In Scope
- Context management (create, prime, update, validate)
- PRD lifecycle management
- Command system infrastructure
- GitLab integration basics
- Session persistence mechanisms
- Documentation and validation

### Out of Scope
- External API integrations (except GitLab)
- GUI/web interface
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Cloud storage/sync
- Non-GitLab version control systems

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- Working context persistence between sessions
- PRD creation and parsing capabilities
- Command validation and error handling
- Basic GitLab integration
- Comprehensive documentation

### Should Have
- MCP Thread Continuity integration
- Automated context updates
- Advanced GitLab features
- Performance optimization
- Extended command library

### Could Have
- Web dashboard
- Analytics and metrics
- Team collaboration features
- Cloud backup
- IDE plugins

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within Claude Code environment
- File-based storage only (no database)
- Markdown configuration format
- Local execution only
- Git as version control

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer maintenance
- No external dependencies
- Minimal system requirements
- Open source model

### Time Constraints
- Immediate need for basic functionality
- Iterative development approach
- Feature prioritization based on usage

## Stakeholders

### Direct Users
- Individual developers using Claude Code
- Product managers creating specifications
- DevOps engineers automating workflows

### Indirect Beneficiaries
- Development teams adopting AI tools
- Organizations using GitLab
- Claude Code community

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Claude Code API changes
- **Mitigation**: Minimal coupling, version compatibility checks

### Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: Learning curve for new users
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, clear error messages

### Maintenance Risks
- **Risk**: Feature creep
- **Mitigation**: Strict scope management, modular architecture

## Deliverables

### Phase 1 (Complete)
- Core command infrastructure
- Basic context management
- PRD workflow implementation
- Initial documentation

### Phase 2 (Current)
- Context validation enhancements
- GitLab integration expansion
- Performance optimization
- Extended documentation

### Phase 3 (Planned)
- MCP integration
- Advanced automation
- Analytics dashboard
- Community features
